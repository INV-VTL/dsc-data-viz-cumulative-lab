    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "You've completed the data visualization section — excellent work. Now we're going to do some rudimentary analysis of Shakespeare's classic play: Macbeth! You will get practice working with lists and dictionaries, conditionals, visualizing data, and thinking analytically about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Apply string methods to make changes to a string\n",
    "* Use a `for` loop to iterate over a collection\n",
    "* Assign values in a dictionary\n",
    "* Use data visualizations to present your findings\n",
    "\n",

    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural language processing** (also known as **NLP**) is a major subfield within data science. At its most advanced, NLP has helped us build interactive AI assistants like Siri and Alexa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in a simpler business context where you just need to summarize the contents of a dataset, text data often requires much more substantial preprocessing work compared to data that is already in a numeric format.\n",
    "\n",
    "One typical technique for understanding a text dataset is to find the **most common** or **least common** words. To do this, we need to build a ***Frequency Distribution*** table, just like when we were finding the mode of a dataset. We'll display the thousands of word frequencies as a **histogram**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can find the mode (the word that appears most often), as well as the \"runner-up\" words, in order to describe a large text dataset with a minimal set of words and numbers. We'll display this information as a **bar graph** with the words as labels on the x-axis and the counts as the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab we'll be using the **full text of Shakespeare's Macbeth**. We will retrieve it for you from the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) website in the format of a single (giant) string, containing over one hundred thousand characters. We'll refer to this string variously as the \"document\", \"corpus\", or \"text dataset\", all terms used frequently within NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't recommend that you try to print the entire string due to its length, but if you're curious about any particular segment, you can use string slicing just like any other string. E.g. `macbeth[1000:2000]` will select just the slice from the 1000th to the 2000th character.\n",
    "\n",
    "When counting the words, make sure you remove any punctuation and convert all words to lowercase. We want all of the following strings to be counted as instances of `\"is\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `\"is\"`\n",
    " - `\"Is\"`\n",
    " - `\"is,\"`\n",
    " - `\"is!\"`\n",
    " - etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Word Count Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract each word from the document and print a count of all words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Unique Word Count\n",
    "\n",
    "First, clean up the collection of words so all punctuation is removed and every word is lowercase. Then print a count of the unique words in that collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Frequency Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the cleaned collection of words, build a frequency table that has the words as keys and the counts of those words as values. From that frequency table, print the modal (most common) word as well as the least common word, along with their frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Histogram:** Using Matplotlib or Seaborn, create a histogram of all of the word frequencies in Macbeth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bar graph:** Using Matplotlib or Seaborn, create a bar graph of the 25 most common words in Macbeth, from the 1st to 25th most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Data\n",
    "Here we start by importing a Python package called `requests`. You'll see this package described in more detail in future lessons, but for now all you need to know is that it allows us to fetch data over the internet!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use it to pull the transcript of Macbeth from the Project Gutenberg website, specifically [this page](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2264/pg2264.txt). We'll also preview a few details about what is now stored in the variable `macbeth`. As you can see, it's a string with 103,605 characters - the first 500 of which are printed below. "
